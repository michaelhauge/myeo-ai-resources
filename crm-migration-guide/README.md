## Real-World Migration Stories

These are composite case studies based on common CRM migration patterns in SEA. Names and details are anonymized.

### Migration Story 1: Malaysian B2B Services Company (HubSpot → Zoho CRM)

**Company**: 18-person consulting firm in KL, managing 200+ accounts primarily via WhatsApp and email. On HubSpot Professional ($900/month for 10 users).

**Why they migrated**: HubSpot Professional was 25% of their total SaaS spend. They used CRM for contact management and deal tracking — not marketing automation. Paying $900/month for features they didn't use.

**What went wrong**:
- Field mapping was harder than expected — HubSpot's "Deal Stage" names didn't match Zoho's defaults. Took an extra 3 hours to create custom stages.
- 6 months of email communication history didn't export from HubSpot (only metadata, not full email bodies). Team panicked about losing context.
- Zoho's WhatsApp integration required WhatsApp Business API verification — took 2.5 weeks for Malaysian business registration approval
- Two sales reps continued using HubSpot secretly for 3 weeks after migration because "Zoho looks different"

**The save**: They kept HubSpot in read-only mode for 90 days (downgraded to free plan) so reps could reference old emails. By Month 2, nobody opened HubSpot anymore.

**Actual results**:
- Cost: $900/month → $252/month (72% reduction, $7,776/year saved)
- Migration time: 12 hours total (planned for 6 — field mapping and WhatsApp setup took longer)
- WhatsApp integration: Working by Week 4 (native in Zoho, previously required $50/month third-party tool with HubSpot)
- Team adoption: Full by Week 6 (slower than hoped, but complete)

**Key takeaway**: Keep old CRM accessible (read-only) for 90 days during transition. Don't cut off access immediately — it causes panic and resistance.

### Migration Story 2: Singapore SaaS Startup (Salesforce → Freshsales)

**Company**: 12-person B2B SaaS selling across SG and Thailand. On Salesforce Professional ($80/user × 10 users = $800/month) since founding.

**Why they migrated**: Salesforce was too complex for a 12-person team. Only 2 people could configure reports. Sales reps spent more time updating Salesforce than selling. Nobody used the mobile app because it was too slow.

**What went wrong**:
- Freshsales' one-click migration imported contacts and deals but missed custom objects — they had a "Partners" custom object in Salesforce that required manual recreation
- 3 Zapier automations connected to Salesforce broke after migration. Had to rebuild them pointing to Freshsales (took 4 hours, not the "zero downtime" they expected)
- Salesforce's 2-year contract had a 60-day cancellation notice requirement — they kept paying for Salesforce for 2 months while using Freshsales (doubled CRM cost temporarily)
- One executive resisted because "Salesforce looks better on our investor deck" — a real concern at fundraising stage

**Actual results**:
- Cost: $800/month → $390/month (51% reduction, $4,920/year saved after accounting for overlap period)
- Migration time: 5 hours (one-click migration + manual custom object rebuild)
- Mobile app adoption: 0% → 80% of reps (Freshsales mobile actually works)
- Report creation: Only 2 people could do it in Salesforce → all reps can build basic reports in Freshsales

**Key takeaway**: Check your current contract's cancellation terms BEFORE starting migration. Early termination fees or notice periods can eat into first-year savings.

## SEA-Specific Considerations

### WhatsApp Integration

| CRM | WhatsApp Support | How It Works | Cost |
|-----|------------------|--------------|------|
| **Zoho CRM** | ✅ Native | Built-in WhatsApp Business API | $0.005-0.01/message |
| **Freshsales** | ⚠️ Via n8n/Zapier | Requires workflow automation | $0-50/month (n8n hosting) |
| **Pipedrive** | ⚠️ Via add-ons | Third-party apps or n8n | $20-50/month |
| **Attio** | ⚠️ Via n8n/API | Custom integration needed | $0-50/month (n8n hosting) |

**Verdict**: If WhatsApp is critical (Indonesia, Malaysia markets), **Zoho CRM** is the only practical choice with native integration.

---

### LINE Integration (Thailand)

**Bad news**: No CRM has native LINE integration.

**Solution**: Use n8n (workflow automation) to connect LINE Official Account API with your CRM.

**Cost**: $0-6/month (n8n self-hosted on Oracle Cloud Free or Contabo VPS)

**See**: [n8n SEA Guide](../n8n-sea-guide/) for LINE integration setup

---

### Payment Methods

| CRM | Credit Card | PayPal | Bank Transfer | Local Methods |
|-----|-------------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Zoho** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ GIRO (SG), local banks |
| **Freshsales** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Pipedrive** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Attio** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**SEA Advantage**: Zoho CRM accepts local payment methods, making it easier for businesses without international credit cards.

---

## Common Migration Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Not Cleaning Data First

**Problem**: Importing messy data (duplicates, invalid emails, inconsistent formatting)

**Solution**: Use our `data-cleanup.py` script before importing. Saves hours of manual cleanup later.

---

### Pitfall 2: Incomplete Field Mapping

**Problem**: Custom fields from HubSpot/Salesforce don't map to new CRM

**Solution**: Use `field-mapper.py` to generate mapping report. Create custom fields in new CRM BEFORE importing data.

---

### Pitfall 3: Not Testing Workflows

**Problem**: Automation rules and workflows break after migration

**Solution**: Manually recreate top 3-5 critical workflows in new CRM. Test before canceling old CRM.

---

### Pitfall 4: Rushing the Cutover

**Problem**: Canceling old CRM too quickly, discovering data issues later

**Solution**: Run old + new CRM in parallel for 30 days. Verify everything works before canceling.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I really migrate in 2-4 hours?

**A**: Yes, for teams <25 people with standard CRM usage (contacts, deals, companies, activities). Larger teams or complex customizations may take 8-12 hours.

Freshsales one-click migration is fastest (1-2 hours total).

---

### Q: Will I lose data during migration?

**A**: No, if you follow our guides and use our validation scripts. The migration process is:
1. Export from old CRM (data stays in old CRM)
2. Clean and map data
3. Import to new CRM
4. Verify data matches
5. Run parallel for 30 days before canceling old CRM

---

### Q: What about email history?

**A**: Most CRMs store email metadata (subject, date, sender/recipient). Full email bodies may not export, depending on your source CRM.

**Workaround**: Keep old CRM in read-only mode for 90 days to reference email history if needed.

---

### Q: Can I migrate just contacts first, then deals later?

**A**: Yes, staged migration is possible:
1. Week 1: Import contacts and companies
2. Week 2: Import deals and opportunities
3. Week 3: Import activities and notes

This reduces risk and allows you to verify each stage.

---

### Q: What if I'm not tech-savvy?

**A**: Our guides are written for non-technical business leaders. If you can use Excel/Google Sheets, you can follow these guides.

**Alternative**: Hire a freelancer on Upwork ($50-200) to handle migration using our scripts.
